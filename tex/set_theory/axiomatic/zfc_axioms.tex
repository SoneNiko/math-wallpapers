Let $(V, \in)$ be a universe of sets. The Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms (with Choice) are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Extensionality: Sets with the same elements are equal.
  \item Empty Set: There exists a set with no elements.
  \item Pairing: For any $a, b$, there is a set $\{a, b\}$.
  \item Union: For any set $A$, $\bigcup A$ exists.
  \item Power Set: For any set $A$, $\mathcal{P}(A)$ exists.
  \item Infinity: There exists an infinite set.
  \item Replacement: Images of sets under definable functions are sets.
  \item Foundation: Every non-empty set has an $\in$-minimal element.
  \item Choice: Every family of non-empty sets has a choice function.
\end{itemize}
